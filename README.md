# PR_Creation

A lightweight repository to practice clean Git branching and pull request workflows, with Jira-linked commit conventions.

## Quick Start
1. Fork/clone the repo.
2. Create a feature branch from the default branch (e.g., `main`).
3. Make focused changes.
4. Commit with a Jira key prefix.
5. Push and open a Pull Request.

## Branch Naming
Use the Jira key and a short slug:
- Example: SCRUM-7-Fix-README
- Pattern: <JIRAKEY>-<short-action-or-feature>

## Commit Messages
Prefix with the Jira key and a concise summary:
- Example: SCRUM-7: Update README with usage and PR steps

## Create a Pull Request
- Compare your feature branch against the default branch.
- Title: Include the Jira key (e.g., SCRUM-7: Fix README).
